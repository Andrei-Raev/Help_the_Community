        <h3>The brony community:</h3>
        <p>
            The series received widespread praise from both television critics and parental groups. It also found an
            unlikely audience in a large group of adult internet users in late 2010 and early 2011, forming a
            subculture.
            These fans, mostly male, were drawn to the show's characters, stories, animation style and influence of the
            show's propagation as an Internet meme. The fandom adopted the name brony (plural bronies), a portmanteau of
            "bro" and "pony".
